       <h3>Description</h3>
       <p>Pumpkin, gingersnaps, and pecans team up to form the ultimate fall cheesecake. A spider web marbling makes it extra spooky for Halloween. Start ahead, because if there's one word that describes this cheesecake, it's 'chilling.' </p>
       <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul><h4>Gingersnap and Pecan Crust</h4>
              <li>cooking spray</li>
              <li>48 gingersnap cookies</li>
              <li>1/2 cup pecan pieces</li>
              <li>1/2 cup salted butter, melted</li>
       </ul>
       <ul><h4>Pumpkin Cheesecake</h4> 
              <li>4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
              <li>1 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
              <li>4 eggs, at room temperature</li>
              <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
              <li>1 cup canned pumpkin puree</li>
              <li>1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice blend</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Steps</h3>
       <ol>
             <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 10-inch springform pan with cooking spray and wrap the outside with foil.</li>
             <li>Pulse gingersnap cookies into fine crumbs in a food processor. Transfer to a medium mixing bowl. Pulse pecans in the same food processor bowl until finely ground. Add to the cookie mixture and mix in melted butter.</li>
             <li>Press the cookie and pecan mixture into the bottom and halfway up the sides of the springform pan.</li>
             <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on the edges, about 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
             <li>Beat cream cheese with sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, stopping occasionally to scrape the sides of the bowl, until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating just until combined and scraping the sides of the bowl after each addition. Beat in vanilla extract.</li>
             <li>Pour about 1/2 of the batter into a different bowl and set aside.</li>
             <li>Add pumpkin puree and pumpkin spice to the batter in the stand mixer bowl and mix until combined.</li>
              <li>Transfer 1/4 cup of the plain batter into a piping bag or plastic storage bag. Spread the rest over the pie crust. Top with the pumpkin cheesecake batter.</li>
              <li>Pipe remaining plain batter into 5 concentric circles on the top of the cheesecake. Drag the tip of a toothpick or small knife out from the center of the batter to the edge, wiping it down between each pull, to create a spider web effect.</li>
              <li>Place the springform pan in the bottom of a roasting pan; fill roasting pan halfway up with warm water to create a water bath.</li>
              <li>Carefully transfer cheesecake to the oven and bake until edges are set, top is no longer shiny, and center is still a little jiggly, about 1 hour and 10 minutes.</li>
              <li>Turn the oven off and prop the door open at least 4 inches. Leave the cheesecake in the oven for an additional 30 minutes.</li>
              <li>Remove cheesecake from the oven and water bath. Run a knife around the edge to prevent sticking and cool on a cooling rack for 30 minutes more. Cover loosely and chill for at least 6 hours, or overnight.</li>
              <li>Run a knife around the edge of the pan and carefully remove the sides of the springform pan. Slice and serve.</li>
